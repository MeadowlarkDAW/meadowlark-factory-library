# Meadowlark Factory Library

> This project has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Meadowlark/meadowlark-factory-library).

The factory library used in the open source [Meadowlark] DAW.

All samples and presets found in this repo are licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero] (CC0) license.

---

Feel free to open a PR to submit any samples or presets to be reviewed for inclusion in this library!

Even if you do not create content, feel free to leave a review of any pending user-submitted content under the "Pull requests" and "Issues" tabs above.

Before submitting any content, please review our rules:

1. You agree that any samples and presets you submit will be licensed under CC0 once it is included in the main branch. If you are the original author, you may put your name or username in the metadata of the content (as long as your username is not innapropriate), but understand that no one using the content is required to provide any attribution.
2. Any content linked in a URL must be licenced as either CC0 or public domain. Content under any other license will not be accepted (including CC-BY).
3. When submitting content directly, unless you have earned the trust of our moderators, you must provide proof that you are the original author (or proof that the original author has agreed to license the samples under CC0). A good form of proof is the project file itself used to create the samples (make sure the moderators are able to open the file). You must provide sources for any samples or presets used in making your content. If you have used any sample or preset not licensed under CC0 or public domain, we will not accept it.
4. We reserve the right to accept and deny any content for inclusion in the main branch. We strive for only quality samples and presets, and we have the final say in what counts as quality content.
5. We also reserve the right to rename and reorganize any included content to keep consistency within the library.
6. Innapropriate content or behavior will be immediately rejected. We reserve the right to determine what is considered appropriate content. Please review our [Code of Conduct].

Feel free to join our [Discord Server] under the "samples-and-presets" channel if you are interested in contributing.
